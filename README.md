# 3D-Tic-Tac-Toe
In this project I created a 4x4x4 Tic Tac Toe as well as 3 agents that one can play against.

Feel free to open the "index.html" file with any browser and explore the game.

All you need in order to play, is a gcc compiler and your imagination :v


I don't know much about licenses but you may use/change/enhance my code for non-commercial purposes, as long as you mention my github repository as a source.
